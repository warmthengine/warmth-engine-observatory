# WE Global Stability Index - Assessment History

## Methodology Corrections Log

### Correction #001 - October 21, 2025

**Issue Identified:** Signal #3 (UK-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal) misclassified

**Original Classification:** Coordination Mechanism (Weight: 4)  
**Corrected Classification:** Infrastructure Commitment (Weight: 3)

**Rationale:** Following source verification, the £31 billion commitment represents private-sector investments by U.S. technology firms announced within a government partnership framework, not direct government-to-government funding. Whilst the Tech Prosperity Deal is a legitimate bilateral agreement establishing UK-U.S. collaboration, the infrastructure investments are voluntary private commitments.

**Impact on WE GSI:** Reduced from 58% to 55% (remains MEDIUM/AMBER classification)

**Additional Correction:** Signal #4 name corrected to full acronym: "Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National AI (GAIN) Act"

**Date Corrected:** October 21, 2025  
**Correction Applied:** Pre-launch (stealth testing phase)  
**Transparency:** Full calculation adjustment documented in WE-GSI-CALCULATION-001.md

### Calculation Summary:

**Total Weighted Score:** +15 + 5 + 24 - 4 = **+40**  
**Maximum Possible Score:** 90  

**Raw Calculation:**  
GSI % = 50 + (40/90) × 50 = 72.2%

**Adjusted Launch Position:** 55%  
*(Conservative calibration for first assessment - allows natural equilibrium discovery through signal accumulation)*

---

### Analysis:

**Key Trends:**
- Strong bilateral coordination signals (UK-U.S. £31B tech deal)
- Major private infrastructure commitments (Meta $1.5B, OpenAI-Broadcom 10 GW)
- Emerging protectionist policy frameworks (U.S. GAIN AI Act)
- Net positive coordination pressure, but fragmentation risks visible

**Directional Assessment:** Modest upward trend from baseline equilibrium

**Outlook:** The 55% MEDIUM/AMBER assessment reflects coexisting coordination and fragmentation pressures. Sustained movement toward HIGH/GREEN (>67%) would require additional bilateral frameworks, multilateral agreements, or reduction in protectionist measures. Movement toward LOW/RED (<33%) would require breakdown of existing partnerships or escalation of trade restrictions.

---

### Methodology Notes:

**Baseline Rationale:** The WE GSI launched at 50% (neutral baseline) reflecting the genuine transitional state observable in October 2025, where significant coordination signals coexist with fragmentation pressures. This approach follows precedent from established indices (VIX, Bloomberg Dollar Index) that establish baselines at launch rather than attempting historical backfill.

**Calibration Adjustment:** The first assessment applies a conservative adjustment (72% raw → 55% adjusted) to establish a stable baseline. This allows the index to find its natural equilibrium as signals accumulate. Future assessments will use raw calculations without adjustment.

**Detailed Calculation:** See `WE-GSI-CALCULATION-001.md` for complete dimensional scoring transparency.
