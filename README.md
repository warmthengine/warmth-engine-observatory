## Overview

The Warmth Engine Observatory is an independent monitoring platform tracking coordination signals in global AI infrastructure development. Using the **C-MAD framework** (Computational Mutual Assured Destruction), we analyze how nation-states, corporations, and institutions coordinate around AI compute resources.

**Live Platform:** [warmthengine.github.io/warmth-engine-observatory](https://warmthengine.github.io/warmth-engine-observatory/warmth-engine-observatory.html)

---

## Status

**Launch Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Version:** Beta v1.0  
**Maturity Level:** Experimental methodology with 4-signal foundation  
**Current Assessment:** 72% (HIGH/GREEN - Strong Coordination Pressure)  
**Recommendation:** Directional intelligence input; methodological validation ongoing  
**Track Record:** Establishing (launched October 2025)

**Beta Caveats:**
- Small sample size (4 signals) → expect volatility as signals accumulate
- Subjective dimensional scoring → inter-rater reliability testing planned for Q1 2026
- Unproven prediction accuracy → building track record over 6-12 months
- Western observability bias → limited coverage of China/Russia/classified programs

For detailed limitations, see the [Methodology](https://warmthengine.github.io/warmth-engine-observatory/) section.

## What We Track

The Observatory monitors four categories of coordination signals:

1. **Infrastructure Commitments** - Data center announcements, power allocations, compute buildouts
2. **Policy Frameworks** - Legislation, treaties, and regulatory coordination
3. **Corporate Partnerships** - Joint ventures, resource-sharing agreements, silicon development
4. **Grid Integration** - Energy infrastructure coordination, renewable energy commitments

### WE Global Stability Index (WE GSI)

Our primary metric is the **WE GSI** - a 0-100% gauge measuring the intensity of AI infrastructure coordination:

- **0-33% (RED)** - Low coordination, fragmented development
- **34-66% (AMBER)** - Moderate coordination, emerging patterns
- **67-100% (GREEN)** - High coordination, systemic integration

Current Position: **50%** (MEDIUM/AMBER)

---

## Methodology

### C-MAD Framework

**Computational Mutual Assured Destruction** - The concept that AI infrastructure creates bilateral dependencies similar to Cold War nuclear deterrence. When nations and corporations interlock their compute resources, they create mutual vulnerability that paradoxically produces stability.

### Analytical Prophecy

We practice **participant-observer methodology** - documenting coordination patterns as they emerge, acknowledging we cannot prove whether coordination is intentional or emergent. Our analysis aims to make coordination dynamics visible, not to advocate for or against them.

### Signal Criteria

Signals must meet these standards:
- **Primary source verification** - Direct links to official announcements
- **Materiality** - Significant resource commitments or policy changes
- **Relevance** - Clear connection to AI infrastructure coordination
- **Recency** - Recent developments (prioritize last 30 days)
