## Document Purpose

This document establishes the complete methodology underlying the Warmth Engine Observatory - the world's first AI infrastructure coordination intelligence platform. It operationalises the C-MAD (Computational Mutual Assured Destruction) framework and Analytical Prophecy Methodology for real-time assessment of global AI infrastructure coordination patterns.

## Novel Contributions (WEO-Specific)

### 1. WE Global Stability Index (WE GSI)
The first quantitative assessment framework for AI infrastructure coordination:
- **Scale:** 0-100% coordination measurement
- **Structure:** Five-dimensional scoring system
- **Methodology:** Bipolar assessment (-2 to +2 per dimension)
- **Output:** Real-time stability categorisation (LOW/RED, MEDIUM/AMBER, HIGH/GREEN)

### 2. Coordination Signal Classification
Systematic detection and categorisation of infrastructure coordination patterns:
- **Impact Assessment:** High/Medium/Low classification
- **Confidence Scoring:** Evidence quality evaluation
- **Temporal Tracking:** Bi-weekly monitoring cadence
- **Multi-Source Verification:** Primary source validation requirements

### 3. Operational Intelligence Platform
First commercial application of C-MAD framework to technology infrastructure:
- **Real-time monitoring:** Bi-weekly signal updates
- **Historical tracking:** Signal archive and trend analysis
- **Multi-format access:** Web interface, JSON API, CSV export, RSS feed
- **Cross-domain integration:** Technological, Financial, Psychological, Governance analysis

## Five-Dimensional Scoring Framework

The WE GSI operationalises APMF's Four-Headed Analysis plus temporal momentum:

### Dimension 1: Technological Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Infrastructure integration vs. sovereignty assessment

### Dimension 2: Financial Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Capital flow openness vs. restrictions analysis

### Dimension 3: Psychological Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Trust formation vs. adversarial positioning evaluation

### Dimension 4: Governance Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Policy alignment vs. fragmentation measurement

### Dimension 5: Temporal Momentum (-1 to +1)
Recent directional change across all dimensions (90-day window)

**Calculation:**
```
Signal Score = Sum of dimensional scores (-10 to +10 range)
Weighted Score = Signal Score × Signal Type Weight (1-4)
WE GSI % = 50 + (Total Weighted Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 50
```

## Foundation Frameworks

The Warmth Engine Observatory is built upon original research documented in The Warmth Engine Series (published Substack, submitted SSRN October 10, 2025):

### Core Methodological Frameworks:
1. **Analytical Prophecy Methodology Framework (APMF)**
   - Pattern recognition in systematic opacity
   - Four-Headed Analysis structure
   - Coordination-emergence uncertainty management
   - Post-convergence strategic analysis

2. **C-MAD Framework (Computational Mutual Assured Destruction)**
   - Game-theoretic stability analysis
   - Stag Hunt vs. Prisoner's Dilemma dynamics
   - Operational-phase coordination pressure assessment
   - Infrastructure concentration vulnerability modelling

3. **Additional Original Frameworks (10 more)**
   - The Hydra Framework
   - The Warmth Engine Framework
   - The Alexandria Framework
   - The Citadel (Operational Convergence)
   - Sequential Investment Vehicles Theory
   - Non-Retrofittable Infrastructure Thesis
   - Climate Authorisation Infrastructure
   - Processing Colonialism Theory
   - Coordination-Emergence Uncertainty Principle
   - Infrastructure-Based Enforcement Architecture

## Observable Outcomes Prioritisation

Evidence quality hierarchy (APMF compliance):

**Tier 1 (100% weight):** Actual infrastructure built, enacted legislation, deployed capital  
**Tier 2 (75% weight):** Signed commitments with timelines and deliverables  
**Tier 3 (50% weight):** Stated intent, non-binding agreements  
**Tier 4 (0% weight):** Rumours, speculation, unverifiable claims  

---

## Known Limitations & Systematic Biases

Epistemic boundaries (transparency commitment):

**Observable:**
- Announced policies and enacted regulations
- Verifiable infrastructure commitments
- Public investment data and trade flows
- Observable facility builds

**Unknowable:**
- Classified military AI programs (~20-40% of compute)
- Informal coordination mechanisms
- True policy effectiveness vs. stated goals
- Proprietary development specifications

**Systematic Biases:**
- Western source bias (English-language dominance)
- Observability bias (fragmentation signals more visible)
- Recency bias (temporal momentum privileges recent events)
- Publication lag (trade data 6-12 months delayed)

## Intellectual Priority Statement

**Warmth Engine Observatory launched:** October 2025  
**Foundation research established:** October 10, 2025 (SSRN submission)  
**Public timestamping:** Substack publication, Internet Archive, OpenTimestamps  

All underlying frameworks represent original intellectual contributions with established priority through multiple independent verification systems.

## Methodology Evolution

This framework continues to evolve through:
- Empirical testing against real-world coordination patterns
- Community feedback and peer review
- Academic engagement and validation
- Operational deployment refinement

**Framework Version:** 1.0  
**Next Review:** January 2026 (Quarterly)
