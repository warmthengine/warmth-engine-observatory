## Document Purpose

This document establishes the complete methodology underlying the Warmth Engine Observatory - the world's first AI infrastructure coordination intelligence platform. It operationalises the C-MAD (Computational Mutual Assured Destruction) framework and Analytical Prophecy Methodology for real-time assessment of global AI infrastructure coordination patterns.

## Novel Contributions (WEO-Specific)

### 1. WE Global Stability Index (WE GSI)
The first quantitative assessment framework for AI infrastructure coordination:
- **Scale:** 0-100% coordination measurement
- **Structure:** Five-dimensional scoring system
- **Methodology:** Bipolar assessment (-2 to +2 per dimension)
- **Output:** Real-time stability categorisation (LOW/RED, MEDIUM/AMBER, HIGH/GREEN)

### 2. Coordination Signal Classification
Systematic detection and categorisation of infrastructure coordination patterns:
- **Impact Assessment:** High/Medium/Low classification
- **Confidence Scoring:** Evidence quality evaluation
- **Temporal Tracking:** Bi-weekly monitoring cadence
- **Multi-Source Verification:** Primary source validation requirements

### 3. Operational Intelligence Platform
First commercial application of C-MAD framework to technology infrastructure:
- **Real-time monitoring:** Bi-weekly signal updates
- **Historical tracking:** Signal archive and trend analysis
- **Multi-format access:** Web interface, JSON API, CSV export, RSS feed
- **Cross-domain integration:** Technological, Financial, Psychological, Governance analysis

## Five-Dimensional Scoring Framework

The WE GSI operationalises APMF's Four-Headed Analysis plus temporal momentum:

### Dimension 1: Technological Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Infrastructure integration vs. sovereignty assessment

### Dimension 2: Financial Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Capital flow openness vs. restrictions analysis

### Dimension 3: Psychological Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Trust formation vs. adversarial positioning evaluation

### Dimension 4: Governance Head Coordination (-2 to +2)
Policy alignment vs. fragmentation measurement

### Dimension 5: Temporal Momentum (-1 to +1)
Recent directional change across all dimensions (90-day window)

**Calculation:**
```
Signal Score = Sum of dimensional scores (-10 to +10 range)
Weighted Score = Signal Score × Signal Type Weight (1-4)
WE GSI % = 50 + (Total Weighted Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 50
```

## Foundation Frameworks

The Warmth Engine Observatory is built upon original research documented in The Warmth Engine Series (published Substack, submitted SSRN October 10, 2025):

### Core Methodological Frameworks:
1. **Analytical Prophecy Methodology Framework (APMF)**
   - Pattern recognition in systematic opacity
   - Four-Headed Analysis structure
   - Coordination-emergence uncertainty management
   - Post-convergence strategic analysis

2. **C-MAD Framework (Computational Mutual Assured Destruction)**
   - Game-theoretic stability analysis
   - Stag Hunt vs. Prisoner's Dilemma dynamics
   - Operational-phase coordination pressure assessment
   - Infrastructure concentration vulnerability modelling

3. **Additional Original Frameworks (10 more)**
   - The Hydra Framework
   - The Warmth Engine Framework
   - The Alexandria Framework
   - The Citadel (Operational Convergence)
   - Sequential Investment Vehicles Theory

## Observable Outcomes Prioritisation

Evidence quality hierarchy (APMF compliance):

**Tier 1 (100% weight):** Actual infrastructure built, enacted legislation, deployed capital  
**Tier 2 (75% weight):** Signed commitments with timelines and deliverables  
**Tier 3 (50% weight):** Stated intent, non-binding agreements  
**Tier 4 (0% weight):** Rumours, speculation, unverifiable claims

## Signal Archive vs. Assessment Window

The Warmth Engine Observatory uses a dual-timeframe approach to balance historical depth with current relevance:

### Signal Archive (Cumulative Tracking)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive historical record of all coordination signals

**Scope:**
- All signals tracked since September 16, 2025 (earliest signal: UK-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal)
- Cumulative count displayed in platform stats dashboard
- Infrastructure commitment figures are similarly cumulative
- Provides depth and context for long-term trend analysis

**Principle:** Infrastructure investments do not expire. A data centre announced in September 2025 remains part of the coordination landscape in 2026. The archive grows continuously to establish historical patterns and validate predictive frameworks.

---

### Assessment Window (Rolling Calculation)

**Purpose:** Current coordination climate measurement

**Scope:**
- WE GSI calculation uses signals from most recent assessment period (typically 30-90 days)
- Current assessment: 30 days (all available signals during launch phase)
- Standard window: 90 days (to be implemented January 2026 once sufficient signal history exists)
- Ensures index reflects current coordination dynamics rather than historical patterns

**Rationale for Rolling Window:**

1. **Signal Decay:** Infrastructure announcements from 6+ months ago have diminished relevance to current coordination pressure. A bilateral agreement from January has less influence on July's coordination climate than recent signals.

2. **Temporal Momentum:** Recent signals (last 90 days) better indicate directional trends and acceleration/deceleration of coordination patterns.

3. **Dynamic Equilibrium:** The index must adapt to changing coordination climate rather than anchoring to historical patterns. Coordination can accelerate or decelerate rapidly in response to geopolitical shifts.

4. **Methodological Precedent:** Established volatility indices (VIX) and economic indicators use rolling windows to maintain current relevance whilst preserving historical context.

### Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1 (October 2025 - December 2025):**
- Assessment window: All available signals (growing from 30 to ~90 days)
- Rationale: Limited archive depth requires using all signals for credible calculation
- WE GSI reflects cumulative coordination pressure during establishment phase

**Phase 2 (January 2026 onwards):**
- Assessment window: Standardised 90-day rolling window
- Signals older than 90 days: Remain in archive but excluded from current WE GSI calculation
- Enables responsive measurement of coordination acceleration/deceleration

**Archive vs. Index Distinction:**
- **"SIGNALS TRACKED"** (dashboard) = Cumulative archive count (grows forever)
- **WE GSI calculation** = Based on assessment window signals only (rolling 90 days)
- This separation allows historical depth whilst maintaining current relevance

---

### Methodological Transparency

**Why this matters:**

Users must understand that:
- Growing signal counts ≠ automatically rising WE GSI
- The index can decrease even as total signals increase (if recent signals are fragmentation-oriented)
- Historical coordination victories don't prevent future fragmentation
- Current coordination climate is what the WE GSI measures

**Example scenario (April 2026):**
- Signal archive: 64 signals tracked since September 2025
- Assessment window: 12 signals from January-March 2026
- If those 12 recent signals show fragmentation, WE GSI decreases despite growing archive

This design prevents "ratchet effect" where index only moves upward and ensures measurement validity during potential coordination breakdown periods.

---

### Key Dates Reference

**Archive Start:** September 16, 2025 (UK-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal)  
**Platform Launch:** October 19, 2025 (Warmth Engine Observatory)

## Known Limitations & Systematic Biases

Epistemic boundaries (transparency commitment):

**Observable:**
- Announced policies and enacted regulations
- Verifiable infrastructure commitments
- Public investment data and trade flows
- Observable facility builds

**Unknowable:**
- Classified military AI programs (~20-40% of compute)
- Informal coordination mechanisms
- True policy effectiveness vs. stated goals
- Proprietary development specifications

**Systematic Biases:**
- Western source bias (English-language dominance)
- Observability bias (fragmentation signals more visible)
- Recency bias (temporal momentum privileges recent events)
- Publication lag (trade data 6-12 months delayed)
