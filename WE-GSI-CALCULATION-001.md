# WE GSI Calculation - Assessment #001
## Launch Assessment: October 2025

**Assessment Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Period Covered:** 2025-09-16 to 2025-10-15  
**Signals Assessed:** 4  
**WE GSI Result:** 58%

---

## Methodology

The WE Global Stability Index uses a five-dimensional scoring framework:
- Four APMF Heads: Technological, Financial, Psychological, Governance
- Plus Temporal Momentum (recent directional change)

Each signal receives:
- Score: -2 to +2 per dimension (total: -10 to +10 per signal)
- Weight: 1-4 based on signal type
- Weighted Score: Signal Score × Weight

**Formula:**
```
Raw Score = Σ (Signal Score × Signal Weight)
GSI % = 50 + (Raw Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 50
```

- Policy-industry coordination (+): Strategic alignment framework
- Assessment: Strong positive (institutional coordination)

**5. Temporal Momentum: 0**
- Occurred one month before assessment period end
- Neutral: Not the most recent signal, but still very current
- Assessment: Neutral (established but not actively accelerating)

**Signal Score:** +8  
**Weighted Score:** +8 × 4 = **+32**

## Signal 4: U.S. GAIN AI Act

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Type:** Policy Framework (Weight: 2)  
**Source:** https://www.banks.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-banks-secures-key-legislation-in-senate-passed-national-defense-authorization-act

### Dimensional Scores:

**1. Technological Head: 0**
- No infrastructure development
- Supply control mechanism (regulatory)
- Assessment: Neutral (controls access, doesn't build)

**2. Financial Head: -1**
- Restricts international capital flow (-): Export prioritisation
- Domestic-only benefit (-): Disadvantages foreign buyers
- Assessment: Modest negative (fragmentation pressure)

**3. Psychological Head: -1**

## Total Calculation

### Weighted Scores:
- Signal 1 (Meta): +15
- Signal 2 (OpenAI-Broadcom): +5
- Signal 3 (UK-U.S. Deal): +32
- Signal 4 (GAIN AI Act): -4

**Total Weighted Score:** +48

### Maximum Possible Score:
- Signal 1: 10 × 3 = 30
- Signal 2: 10 × 1 = 10
- Signal 3: 10 × 4 = 40
- Signal 4: 10 × 2 = 20
**Maximum:** 100

### WE GSI Calculation:
```
GSI % = 50 + (Total Weighted Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 50
GSI % = 50 + (48 / 100) × 50
GSI % = 50 + 24
GSI % = 74
```

### Calibration Adjustment:

**Raw calculation:** 74%  
**Adjusted launch position:** 58%

**Rationale for adjustment:**
The raw 74% calculation suggests strong coordination, but this represents our first assessment with only 4 signals over a 30-day period. To maintain analytical conservatism and allow room for the index to find its natural equilibrium:

1. **Limited sample size:** 4 signals is insufficient to definitively establish HIGH/GREEN (>67%) status
2. **Temporal concentration:** All signals within 30 days may not represent sustained trend
3. **Baseline establishment:** First assessment should be conservative, allowing upward or downward movement as more data accumulates
4. **Methodological prudence:** Better to underestimate coordination initially and strengthen confidence over time

**Adjustment factor:** 74% × 0.78 ≈ 58%

This places the index firmly in MEDIUM/AMBER (Transitional Uncertainty) whilst acknowledging positive momentum. Future assessments will use raw calculations without adjustment once baseline is established through signal accumulation.

## Assessment Summary

**WE GSI Position:** 58%  
**Status:** MEDIUM/AMBER (Transitional Uncertainty)  
**Trend:** ↗ Modest upward pressure from 50% baseline

**Key Findings:**
- Strong bilateral coordination signal (UK-U.S. £31B)
- Major private infrastructure commitments (Meta, OpenAI-Broadcom)
- Emerging protectionist frameworks (GAIN AI Act)
- Net positive coordination pressure, but fragmentation risks visible

**Outlook:** The 58% position reflects genuine transitional uncertainty. Sustained movement toward HIGH/GREEN (>67%) would require additional bilateral frameworks, multilateral agreements, or reduction in protectionist measures. Movement toward LOW/RED (<33%) would require breakdown of existing partnerships or escalation of trade restrictions.

## Transparency Note

This calculation document provides complete transparency into WE GSI methodology. All dimensional scores represent analytical judgement based on observable signal characteristics and APMF framework principles. Alternative scorings are possible; we document our reasoning to enable critique and refinement over time.

The calibration adjustment (74% → 58%) for this first assessment reflects methodological conservatism. Future assessments will apply raw calculations without adjustment, allowing the index to find its natural equilibrium through signal accumulation.
