# WE GSI Calculation - Assessment #001
## Launch Assessment: October 2025

**Assessment Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Period Covered:** 2025-09-16 to 2025-10-15  
**Signals Assessed:** 4  
**WE GSI Result:** 72%

## Methodology

The WE Global Stability Index uses a five-dimensional scoring framework:
- Four APMF Heads: Technological, Financial, Psychological, Governance
- Plus Temporal Momentum (recent directional change)

Each signal receives:
- Score: -2 to +2 per dimension (total: -10 to +10 per signal)
- Weight: 1-4 based on signal type
- Weighted Score: Signal Score × Weight

**Formula:**
```
Raw Score = Σ (Signal Score × Signal Weight)
GSI % = 50 + (Raw Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 50
```

## Assessment Window Methodology

**Signal Archive vs. WE GSI Calculation:**

The Warmth Engine Observatory distinguishes between:

**1. Signal Archive (Cumulative)**
- All signals tracked since September 16, 2025
- Cumulative count displayed in stats dashboard
- Provides historical depth and trend context

**2. Assessment Window (Rolling)**
- WE GSI calculation uses signals from assessment period (typically 30-90 days)
- Current assessment: September 16 - October 15, 2025 (30 days)
- As platform matures, assessment window will standardize to 90 days

**Rationale for Rolling Window:**

A rolling assessment window ensures the WE GSI reflects current coordination dynamics:
- **Signal decay:** Infrastructure announcements from 6 months ago have less relevance to current coordination pressure
- **Temporal momentum:** Recent signals (last 90 days) better indicate directional trends
- **Dynamic equilibrium:** The index adapts to changing coordination climate rather than anchoring to historical patterns

**Future Assessments:**

Once the signal archive exceeds 90 days of coverage, the WE GSI will calculate from a standardized 90-day rolling window. This means:
- Signals older than 90 days remain in the archive (cumulative count)
- But only signals from the most recent 90 days influence the current WE GSI calculation
- This allows the index to respond to acceleration or deceleration in coordination trends

**Current Assessment Period:**
- Start: September 16, 2025 (earliest signal)
- End: October 15, 2025 (latest signal)
- Duration: 30 days (all available signals included)

**Note:** The first 3-6 assessments will use all available signals due to limited archive depth. The 90-day rolling window will be implemented once sufficient signal history exists (approximately January 2026).

## Total Calculation

### Weighted Scores:
- Signal 1 (Meta): +15
- Signal 2 (OpenAI-Broadcom): +5
- Signal 3 (UK-U.S. Deal): +24
- Signal 4 (GAIN AI Act): -4

**Total Weighted Score:** +40

### Maximum Possible Score:
- Signal 1: 10 × 3 = 30
- Signal 2: 10 × 1 = 10
- Signal 3: 10 × 3 = 30
- Signal 4: 10 × 2 = 20
**Maximum:** 90

### WE GSI Calculation:
```
GSI % = 50 + (Total Weighted Score / Maximum Possible Score) × 50
GSI % = 50 + (40 / 90) × 50
GSI % = 50 + 22.2
GSI % = 72.2
```

## Expected Launch Volatility

**The WE GSI is calculated as 72.2% based on 4 signals tracked over 30 days.**

### Why 72% With Limited Data?

**This places the index in HIGH/GREEN territory (>67%), indicating strong coordination pressure. However, with only 4 signals, this position should be interpreted with appropriate caveats:**

**1. Small Sample Volatility**
- With 4 signals, each new signal has ~25% influence on the index
- Early assessments will show larger percentage swings
- This is expected and mathematically normal for small samples

**2. Current Signal Mix**
The 72% position reflects:
- **Strong coordination signals:** UK-U.S. £31B Tech Prosperity Deal (+24 weighted), Meta infrastructure (+15 weighted), OpenAI-Broadcom partnership (+5 weighted)
- **Fragmentation pressure:** GAIN AI Act (-4 weighted)
- **Net effect:** +40 weighted score = strong coordination bias

**3. Natural Equilibrium Discovery**
As signals accumulate over coming months:
- Sample size increases → percentage swings decrease
- Diverse signal mix → more balanced assessments
- The index will find its natural equilibrium through data accumulation

**Expected progression:**
- **Months 1-2 (4-8 signals):** High volatility (±10-15 point swings possible)
- **Months 3-4 (12-20 signals):** Moderate volatility (±5-10 point swings)
- **Months 5-6 (30+ signals):** Stabilizing equilibrium (±2-5 point swings)

### Interpreting the Launch Position

**The 72% (HIGH/GREEN) assessment indicates:**
- Current signal mix strongly favours coordination over fragmentation
- Major bilateral frameworks (UK-U.S.) and infrastructure commitments dominate
- Protectionist measures (GAIN Act) present but outweighed

**This is NOT a prediction that coordination is assured.** 

New signals could shift the index significantly:
- Major fragmentation signal (e.g., export ban) could drop WE GSI 15-20 points
- Additional bilateral agreements could push WE GSI to 80%+
- The index reflects CURRENT pressure, not future trajectory

**Recommendation for users:** 
Monitor directional trends over multiple assessments rather than treating single-assessment position as definitive. The WE GSI becomes more reliable as signal archive grows.

## Methodology Correction (October 20, 2025)

**Initial Assessment (October 19, 2025):**
- Signal #3 classified as Coordination Mechanism (Weight: 4)
- Total Weighted Score: +48
- Maximum Possible Score: 100
- WE GSI: 74% (raw)

**Corrected Assessment (October 20, 2025):**

Following independent verification of primary sources, Signal #3 (UK-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal) was reclassified from Coordination Mechanism (Weight: 4) to Infrastructure Commitment (Weight: 3).

**Rationale:** The £31 billion commitment represents private-sector investments by U.S. tech firms (Microsoft, NVIDIA, Google, CoreWeave, and others) announced within a government-brokered partnership framework, not direct bilateral government funding. Whilst the Tech Prosperity Deal is a legitimate government-to-government agreement establishing collaboration on AI, quantum computing, and nuclear energy research, the financial commitments are voluntary private investments rather than government budget allocations.

**Recalculated Weighted Scores:**
- Signal 1 (Meta): +15
- Signal 2 (OpenAI-Broadcom): +5
- Signal 3 (UK-U.S. Deal): +8 × 3 = **+24** (previously +32)
- Signal 4 (GAIN AI Act): -4

**Total Weighted Score:** +40 (previously +48)  
**Maximum Possible Score:** 90 (previously 100)  
**WE GSI:** 72.2% raw → **72%** displayed (previously 74%)

**Additional Corrections:**
- Signal #4 name updated to full acronym: "Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National AI (GAIN) Act"
- Removed non-methodological calibration adjustment
- WE GSI now displays raw calculated value

**Display Convention:** WE GSI values are displayed rounded to the nearest whole number for clarity (e.g., 72.2% displays as 72%). Raw calculations maintain full precision in data files for verification purposes.

**Transparency Note:** This correction demonstrates our commitment to accuracy over narrative convenience. The corrected position of 72% (HIGH/GREEN) reflects strong coordination pressure from major infrastructure commitments and bilateral frameworks, partially offset by protectionist policy measures. With only 4 signals, early-stage volatility is expected as the index discovers its natural equilibrium through signal accumulation.

## Assessment Summary

**WE GSI Position:** 72%  
**Status:** HIGH/GREEN (Strong Coordination Pressure)  
**Trend:** ↗ Strong upward pressure from 50% baseline

**Key Findings:**
- Strong bilateral coordination signal (UK-U.S. £31B Tech Prosperity Deal)
- Major private infrastructure commitments (Meta, OpenAI-Broadcom)
- Emerging protectionist frameworks (GAIN AI Act)
- Net positive coordination pressure, but fragmentation risks visible

**Outlook:** The 55% position reflects genuine transitional uncertainty. Sustained movement toward HIGH/GREEN (>67%) would require additional bilateral frameworks, multilateral agreements, or reduction in protectionist measures. Movement toward LOW/RED (<33%) would require breakdown of existing partnerships or escalation of trade restrictions.

## Transparency Note

This calculation document provides complete transparency into WE GSI methodology. All dimensional scores represent analytical judgement based on observable signal characteristics and APMF framework principles. Alternative scorings are possible; we document our reasoning to enable critique and refinement over time.

The calibration adjustment (72% → 55%) for this first assessment reflects methodological conservatism. Future assessments will apply raw calculations without adjustment, allowing the index to find its natural equilibrium through signal accumulation.
